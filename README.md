# bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-five

## Overview:

App is somewhat of a continuation of repo 'bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-four'.

### New warning received on both client and server in dev build:

`Warning: Failed context type: The context 'store' is marked as required in 'Component', but its value is 'undefined'`.

=========================================

react-redux v6 uses new context not legacy context.

## Going back over basics and beyond for React, Redux and React-Router. Development skills for config (and more) are good enough and planned to focus entirely on React/Redux at this point anyways so turns out this "warning" is well timed!
